### Dependencies
The project has been developed with the following packages: 
- python 3.8
- numpy 1.19.5
- pandas 1.2.1
- matplotlib 3.3.3
- scikit-learn 0.24.1


### Data

The folder `datasets` contains the two main datasets of the project:

- `gyro_tot_v20180801.txt`:  
  
  Data sample of 1464 stars with accurate ages coming from asteroseismology or cluster belonging. Used to perform the training of the models of all Benchmarks and testing these  models in Benchmarks A and B.  

- `test_gyro.txt`:  
  
  Control data sample of novel non-clustered 32 stars, including the Sun, to examine the age estimation performance of all the models in the Benchmark C.


### Code

The scripts used in the development of this project is in the folder `ai4starsdating/code/training_testing`:

- `train_test_Benchmark_A.py`:  
  Script to evaluate the different regression models following a classical training/test data splitting scheme. From the data sample distribution `datasets/gyro_tot_v20180801.txt`, we release a training set and a testing set, where 80 % and 20 % of the stars have been randomly included, respectively.

- `train_test_Benchmark_B1.py`:  
  Script to evaluate the generalization capability of models, where we train the approaches on young stars, and evaluate their performance on old stars.  
  
- `train_test_Benchmark_B2.py`:  
  Script of a second scenario to evaluate the generalization capability of the models when they are trained only with stars belonging to clusters or only with field stars.

- `train_test_Benchmark_C.py`:  
  Script to examine the age estimation performance of all the models on a control data sample `datasets/test_gyro.txt`, composed only of stars not belonging to any cluster, and with a more realistic age distribution.  
  
There are also four scripts in the folder `ai4starsdating/code/testing`, to test your own models. The next chapter explains how to use both usages.


### Usage  

After cloning or downloading the repo, you can choose between training and testing our models to reproduce our results or testing with some pretrained models, using our models or your own pretrained models.

#### Training and testing  
  
To reproduce our results, training and testing our models, you just have to run the following command in the folder `ai4starsdating/code/training_testing`, taking into account the desire Benchmark:

```bash
python train_test_Benchmark_A.py
python train_test_Benchmark_B1.py  
python train_test_Benchmark_B2.py
python train_test_Benchmark_C.py
```

#### Testing with pretrained models

To test your own pretrained models perfomance, it's necessary to put the models in the folder `ai4starsdating/models`, and then you just have to run the following commands in the folder `ai4starsdating/code/testing`:

```bash
python testing_Benchmark_A.py
python testing_Benchmark_B1.py  
python testing_Benchmark_B2.py
python testing_Benchmark_C.py
```
